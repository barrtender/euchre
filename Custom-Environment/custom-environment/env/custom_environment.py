Defining the Environment

Represent cards as numbers 0-23
 Clubs(c) | Diamond (d) | Heart (h) | Spade (s)
 9 - A    | 9  - A      | 9  - A    | 9  - A
 0 - 5    | 6  - 11     | 12 - 17   | 18 - 23 

Jacks: Jc=3, Jd=9, Jh=15, Js=21

An empty card slot is a -1. For example if a hand had 4 cards of:
Hand:        "Ac, 9h, 10h, Js"
Observation: [ 6, 13,  14, 21, -1]

### Observation Space

Observation Shape: (11,)
Observation Values: [-1,23]

Observation Space

|  Index   | Description
|----------|-------------
|  0 - 4   | Agent's hand 
|  5       | Current trump suit [0,4] in [c, d, h, s], -1 for no called suit yet
|  6 - 8   | Cards previously played this trick. Ordered. So the first entry is the first played and thus the suit to follow 
|  9       | Who called the suit. [0,4] in agent id and -1 for no called suit yet
|  10      | Current offered suit [0,4] in [c, d, h, s] (only after deal until a suit is called)

#### Maybe leave these out, but it's information that people do have.
| 1 | Who led last trick. [0,4] agent id
| 4 | Cards played last trick. Ordered.
| 1 | Who led 2 tricks ago. [0,4] agent id
| 4 | Cards played 2 tricks ago. Ordered.
| 1 | Who led 3 tricks ago. [0,4] agent id
| 4 | Cards played 3 tricks ago. Ordered.
| 1 | Who led 4 tricks ago. [0,4] agent id
| 4 | Cards played 4 tricks ago. Ordered.


### Action Space


|  Index   | Description
|----------|-------------
|  0 - 4   | Play card from agent's hand
|  5 - 13  | Call trump suit [5=c,6=d,7=h,8=s], for alone:[9=c,10=d,11=h,12=s]. 13=pass


### Rewards

Taking a trick should be worth something
Winning the hand should be worth more. Bonus for however many points the hand was worth
